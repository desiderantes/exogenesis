Exogenesis : A Feature Filled Installer
=================
From auroraos.org:

Exogenesis is our own installer which is currently in development. It's been designed and coded from scratch to be simple, quick and effective. You don't need 1000 options when installing; just some quick choices. Exogenesis enables you to install your system quickly and effectively with some new features never seen before.
Exogenesis is currently in active development and we are looking for vala coders to actively get involved in the development. If you are interested please let us know in the Get Involved Forum.
As well as being the installer for Aurora; Exogenesis has actually been written to work on ANY Debian based distribution so multiple projects can intergrate this into their work.
In the coming weeks we will be releasing further information on Exogenesis and some of the features you can expect including a technical specification.

Troubleshooting
---------------

*Do not install this if you already have Xcode installed!* Mixing Xcode and osx-gcc-installer
is known to cause various difficult-to-diagnose problems and is not recommended.

If you intend to only use command line tools you should first uninstall Xcode entirely before
installing osx-gcc-installer, or see below for other options.
